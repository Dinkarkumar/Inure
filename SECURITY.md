## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

I take the security of this project seriously and appreciate the efforts of security 
researchers in identifying and responsibly disclosing security vulnerabilities.

If you believe you've discovered a security vulnerability in this project, I encourage
you to report it to me confidentially. To report a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

1. **Do Not Disclose Publicly:** Please do not share potential vulnerabilities publicly until I have
had a chance to address them.

2. **Email Notification:** Send an email to [Hamza Rizwan](mailto:hamzarizwan243@gmail.com)
   describing
   the potential vulnerability. Please include the following details in your report:

    - Description of the vulnerability and the potential impact.
    - Steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
    - Any relevant technical details that could assist in reproducing or understanding the issue.

3. **Wait for Response:** You should receive an acknowledgment of your report within a few hours. I
   will work
   with you to understand and verify the issue.

4. **Cooperation:** I appreciate your cooperation in keeping the details of the vulnerability
   confidential
   until we've resolved the issue.

## Responsible Disclosure Guidelines

I kindly request that security researchers:

- Provide a reasonable amount of time for me to investigate and address the vulnerability before publicly disclosing it.
- Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations, destruction of data, and disruption of services.
- Only interact with accounts and data you own or have explicit permission to access.

## Legal Protections

I consider security research to be an important contribution to the health and security of this project. 
I will not pursue legal action against individuals who report security vulnerabilities in accordance with 
these guidelines. I do, however, expect security researchers to act responsibly and within the bounds of the law.

Thank you for your contribution to the security of this project.
